Code does the following-
Parllel merge sort implemented using pthreads
Speeds the process of sorting large dataset by 10 times.

To run-
make clean
make

To run this program, you will need to generate input data using ./gen. You can use ./gen to generate a random set of numbers by using, for example:
./gen 100 >file.txt
...to generate 100 numbers.

You can also use ./gen to generate numbers within a range. For example:
./gen --min 0 --max 100 100 >file.txt
...will generate 100 random numbers in the range of [0, 100]. Since the numbers are random, there will almost certainly be duplicates.

To run your program with a given input, supply the number of segments and the input file:
./msort 5 <example1.txt

test the time our program takes to run by using the Linux time command.

With one large segment:
$ time ./msort 1 <example3.txt >/dev/null
Sorted 12345678 elements.
